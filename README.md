# Perron-1989-Table7-ModelsA_C

# Overview 
The goal of this code is to replicate Table 7 of Perron's study titled "The Great Crash, The Oil Price Shock, and The Unit Root Hypothesis" (1989). This paper aimed to prove that when taking into account structural breaks in macroeconomic series it is possible to reject the null hypothesis for unit root. However, some improvements should be made to accurately choose the lag length and the lambda value for each series. Also, this code only includes models A and C. Any recommendations are welcome.
